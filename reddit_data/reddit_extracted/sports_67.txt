25 years from the most memorable Olympic Cauldron lighting - Barcelona '92
This isn't the most memorable for me.  Muhammad Ali standing at the base of the cauldron in Atlanta holding the torch high and shaking with Parkinsons is the one I remember the most.  Every time I watch that again I get teary-eyed.
