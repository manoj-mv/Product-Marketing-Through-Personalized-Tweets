A lawsuit against Apple is launched in France, one of the only countries where planned obsolescence is explicitly illegal
Something I haven’t heard much often if at all on Reddit is this... just because there is an update out for your phone doesn’t mean you should update. Especially with older phones, the best option is to wait a month or two after an update comes out and research how it affects that phone, or if you don’t even need anything from the update, don’t update at all. My CompSci teacher from highschool never updated his phone; he still has an iphone 5 or 4s (i dont remember) running ios 8, and it runs fine. This is regardless of what apple is doing, this is stuff you as a consumer can do to help protect yourself.
