Ingredients on labels might be correct, but the claims weren’t subject to any scrutiny, so what’s the point?people, 100 taking vitamins every day and 100 getting their vitamins straight from food. During the study 68% of those people were diagnosed with cancer(daily vitamin intakes), they don’t know exactly why this is but they assume it’s because the human body isn’t used to breaking down what we currently ingest on a daily bases. That over the course of human history we’ve gotten our nutrients naturally from the earth and from animals that haven’t been genetically altered. I don’t know why this wasn’t a big issue, or why I didn’t see it on TV or in newspapers, but after keeping tabs on the page I one day went to go back to the interview video to find (to my surprise) that there was nothing about it, the page was deleted and when I searched it up it was like it was never there in the first place. I know the government hides stuff from the public, but isn’t this a BIG issue. I honestly don’t know what to say and wanted to post this here and see if anyone read the same article and interview as I did
