Colorado becomes first state in nation to cap price of insulin - Under bill signed by governor this week, diabetics will pay no more than $100 a month for insulin
People could already get it for $25 direct from manufacturer.  This type of legislation will only make prices go up for those who legit need it by artificially setting the low price at $100. Meanwhile the people who could afford the higher prices get to pay less. But as long as dipshit socialists get to feel good about “helping” then that’s all that matter I suppose.
