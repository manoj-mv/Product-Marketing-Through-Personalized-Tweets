Earlier this year, my brother and I bought a car in Georgia and spent 100 days driving across all of Central Asia. It was the most epic trip i've ever done. Here is Caspar(our car) on the Roof of the World, the Pamir Highway. [More in comments]
I see others asking if you felt unsafe, I am glad you didnâ€™t. However as you mentioned it can be dangerous and some travelers were recently killed in Tajikistan. So my question is, when traveling through many of these countries is it ok to bring a gun for self defense, do you know? I would certainly be interested in doing so myself if I travel in this part of the world.
