Most comfortable driver seat for tall (6'4+) folks?
Depends on what you need your vehicle to do for you.  If it's just commuting, German makes tend to be designed to be comfortable for tall folks.  I remember my 1970 VW bug being as comfortable as a 2003 BMW 323i wagon or my 2012 Sportwagen TDI.  The most comfortable seat I've ever owned is my current 2015 Ram 1500 Laramie with adjustable everything (pedals are adjustable, steering wheel, seat is adjustable a bunch of different ways).   I'm 6'4 and HWP.
