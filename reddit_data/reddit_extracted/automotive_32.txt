Cause of sudden throaty exhaust noise?
Depends on where it's leaking.
A cracked manifold can come in at $1000 easy, especially if it has an integrated catalytic converter. If it's just a leaky muffler, joe blow will probably weld a new generic one on for ya for $100ish.  You need to find where it's leaking if you don't want an expensive surprise one it's already up in the air.
