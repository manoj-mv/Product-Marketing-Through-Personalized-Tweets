Over the years I've posted quite a bit of pics here, from my travels to Asia. I thought it fitting with my love of travel to propose to my favorite travel buddy while on a trip in Hakone, Japan. She said yes :)
Congratulations!

Did you take into account the time difference, knowing that she might want to call some people back home to tell them right away?right?
