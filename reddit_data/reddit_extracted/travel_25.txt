First time Athens today and definitely fell in love with this city
Had a somewhat different experience with people trying to con us and alot of beggars.
Also the sidewalks are not very well kept. I sprained my ankle while walking and acckdently stepping in a hole in the sidewalk. This happened often. However the sights was amazing! I loved visiting the acropolis and stumbled across a street market with the most amazing raw ingredients. Was still a wonderfull time.
