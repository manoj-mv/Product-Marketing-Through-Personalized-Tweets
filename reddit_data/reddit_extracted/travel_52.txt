My "land before time" experience at Angels Landing
I was just here two weeks ago and took this exact picture! hike I've ever done. There were patches of eerie fog moving in and out and when heading down we realized many small waterfalls had developed all around us. There were many times we just stopped and basked in the wonder and beauty of that place.
