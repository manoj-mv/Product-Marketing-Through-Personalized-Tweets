Congress introduces â€˜Save the Internet Actâ€™ to overturn Ajit Paiâ€™s disastrous net neutrality repeal and help keep the Internet ðŸ”¥
I'm old enough to remember when 24/25 of the top threads on r/all were warning us that by 2019, the entire internet would be behind a paywall, out speeds would be but by 90% and we'd be back to carving stones in caves.

What happened? Could it be that in fact, NN was one of the biggest fear-mongering campaigns ever waged on the internet and in fact, made no difference to anything since remember; **there was no NN for the vast majority of the internets life, it never stopped its growth or being free**.
