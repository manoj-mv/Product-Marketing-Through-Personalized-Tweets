[Homemade] Grandmas delicious 21 layer jello.
Not gonna lie without the title I'd think this was just some weird square cheese slices stacked on top of each other. then bring it to work in hopes that someone would eat this jello I wasted my time making. But it's a nice fantasy to think I could somehow pull this beautiful jello creation off.

Thanks for posting! Super satisfying to look at.
