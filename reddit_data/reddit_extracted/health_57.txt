The FDA just approved a drug that targets cancers based on DNA, rather than where the tumor is in your body - Out of 109 patients, 81% had an overall response rate, meaning their tumors shrank. In 17% of the cases, the patients had a complete response, meaning their tumors went away entirely.
Isn't this the way a lot of research has been going?  Seems like the right way to go about it given what we've learned about cancer.  ull the weeds from the roots.
