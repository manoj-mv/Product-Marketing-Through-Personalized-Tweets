H.Res.755 - Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors
I completely missed the civics lesson wherein my elected officials just have continue hiring attorneys and filing bullshit briefs and continuances to avoid actually facing legal ramifications.

I figured this was fine for slum lords and shitty real estate jagoffs, but I totally missed the class where it was okay to tell the people who elected me that they could go fuck themselves because I'm rich in my personal life, so it means as a duly elected official I'm completely fine being a total piece of shit where there are zero checks and balances.
