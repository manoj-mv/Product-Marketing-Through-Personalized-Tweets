Brandin Cooks of the LA Rams presents the team's custodian with Super Bowl tickets so he can take his son to the game
Nice of him, even tho rams shouldn't be going.ointed that Cooks even has this opportunity. But regardless of the team or the given situation, this is pretty amazing and genuinely made me smile. Good for you Mr. Cooks!
