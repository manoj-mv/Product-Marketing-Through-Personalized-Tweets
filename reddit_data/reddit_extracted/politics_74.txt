'A Really Chilling Moment': Trump Refuses to Allow Dr. Fauci to Answer Question on Dangers of Hydroxychloroquineâ€” "This is unacceptable. Dr. Fauci, one of the world's top infectious disease scientists, was just censored live at a White House press conference."
This the same drug that killed the guy in Arizona? of this drug, Novartis.

>"What do you have to lose?" 

...translates into 

>"Without any forethought of how this will play out, I'll use the public as test patients and will gladly step over their bodies to collect a profit." 

Trump DOES NOT CARE about treating people or solving the problem. All he cares about is "How can I both make this problem go away AND make a profit off of this?"
