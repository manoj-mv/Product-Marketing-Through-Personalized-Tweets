The Supreme Court Phone Location Case Will Decide the Future of Privacy - Later this year, the Supreme Court will decide if police can track a personâ€™s cell phone location without a warrant. It's the most important privacy case in a generation.
This is basically a way to monitor and track every human like cattle e kind of device that allows them to track cell phones now...I saw that a attorney in some state file a suit because these transmissions devices have to be approved by the Fed since they are like mini cell phone towers. The police are shady there is no privacy in this country. I am glad Apple would not  open their phones for the federal government. The sad thing is the government probably paid huge somes of tax payer money to a private security firms to hack iPhones.
