Tarantino Made ‘Right Decision’ Refusing to Edit ‘Hollywood’ for China
Love how everyone here are so busy hating on China that they conveniently forget it was Bruce Lee's daughter who appealed to the Chinese government because she didn't like how Tarantino was portraying her father. Please continue with the circle jerk though.n't know, I guess if you're from the west coast or L.A. this movie might satisfy based on the scenery and nostalgia then maybe it made up for it.  However, I just don't think it grabbed me like his other films.    
I think there was an element of this also in Hateful Eight, but it wasn't as egregious. The timing sort of fit with the desolate nature of the film's setting.  The L.A. story in Once Upon a Time though deserved something a little snappier.
