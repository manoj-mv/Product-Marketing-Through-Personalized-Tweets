[I Ate] Baguette sandwiches
ok now take a second photo with he face revealedhat had these sandwiches, I love hard cheese and salami sandwiches. But man, the protein amounts just arenâ€™t made for Americans or atleast ones that are used to the gym and eating massive amounts of meat at every meal. I felt so starved the entire time with one thin layer of meat and cheese. Loved the flavors and high quality of them, though.
