What Japanese suv to buy?
I'm doing well! I have a Hyundai Santa Fe. I know it's not Japanese but Korean cars are good too, right? My 2009 Subaru has never given me any issues, let's hope this one does the same.

The AWD is nice if you're in an area that's needs it, but otherwise it's an unnecessary expense and maintenance item.
