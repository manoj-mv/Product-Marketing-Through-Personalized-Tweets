R. Lee Ermey Has Died
I had the pleasure of meeting him at Ft. Benning GA. He was down there for a filming of Mail Call. He was such a humble man and must have thanked me 20 times for serving our country. He only had a brief moment to chat, but he told me that his ribbons and medals on Full Metal Jacket were all his. He was very well decorated. Rest easy friend. I'm glad I had the pleasure of meeting you.
