Megathread: CEO Jack Dorsey says Twitter has decided to ban all political ads by candidates and outside groups
Does that mean Trump's Twitter account will be banned? He trashes dems how many times a day?fake accounts it could be a great first step to reclaiming the Wild West of social media influence. 


I would like to see verified accounts get a temporary“ misleading user” label or red watermark plastered over their posts when they continuously spew falsehoods. Let it be a soft punishment that has some teeth (make the watermark bolder and bolder the more Pinocchio’s they repeat). Allow it to lighten and fade out with a number of days per offense.
