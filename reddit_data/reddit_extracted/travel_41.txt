The Serengeti absolutely blew my mind away
Is nobody going to chide this poster for the carbon and how at this point we should, instead of invading animals' last remaining spaces, just be grateful that there are a few left?  Okay, I'll do it..


Unfortunately the wildlife in Africa is the only sight for sore eyes on the continent (maybe Capetown). Only if the African governments were civilized, efficient and economic development minded imagine how Africa would be if it has a western standards of living and quality of life.
