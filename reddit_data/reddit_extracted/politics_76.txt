Sanders overtakes Biden in New Hampshire poll
Oh this poll I guess were allowed to see on the front page.ed America to a more progressive country, more power to him. I also like Joe Biden. He's a good man and his service to America has been valid. He was a good senator for over 40 years, and he was a great vice president to Barack Obama. However, his middle of the road politics might be not for this time. It always amazed me people think Barack Obama was some radical leftist. Him and Joe where center left at best, but they provided America with was needed at the time. If Bernie Sanders runs with Elizabeth Warren and really flips America to the left, I say fine. These last four years have not been some center right, run of the mill Republican presidency. They have been a total fringe far right wing nightmare. Our president and his policies are absolutely far right facism. So, I say, if America wants to go far left after this horrible presidency, go for it.
