Pixar's Incredibles 2 Trailer
I still think The Incredibles is Pixar's best movie to date. Great story, incredible animation, and a nice mix of humor & pathos. Not saying anything before or since is bad; but nothing has topped Brad Bird's first outing with the company.

So, of course, even this little taste of what's to come has got me excited.
