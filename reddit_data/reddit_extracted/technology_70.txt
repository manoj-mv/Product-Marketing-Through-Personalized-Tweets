Lyft will offer discounted rides to voters during US midterm elections. Voters in underserved communities will get free rides.
My community is so underserved that we dont even have Lyft. Or uber. solve the underlying issue. Voting should be mandatory and polling day should be a national holiday, with penalties enforced on employers who cause any impediment to any of their employees doing their duty and voting. You can't have a democracy when whether people can participate is dependent on external and often economic circumstances.
