Why anybody would ever care about astronomy is beyond me.  I can think of literally thousands upon thousands of things that are more interesting than astronomy.  How styrofoam is made is more interesting than astronomy.  I don't know how it's made, nor do I care, but I'd rather know the entire process than anything about astronomy.
