Trump’s campaign is trying to remove a video of him appearing to call the coronavirus a ‘hoax,’ saying it’s misleading
Someone should ask him point blank "How is the Democrats politicizing this a hoax?"

He will either have to admit that he thinks the virus is a hoax, or he doesn't know what the word hoax means.g out of proportion. He was still very wrong and that wasn't how many Trump supporters took what he said.
