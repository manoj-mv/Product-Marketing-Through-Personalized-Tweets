How was window performance prior to the malfunction? 

Is there any movement or activity from the motor when you push the button?

Regardless, if it were the sensor, you're still SOL since it's often built into the motor unit. 

You can test the motor at home by jumping the motor leads and seeing if you can actuate it manually. This would require removing the door panel.

You would need to ask before the work is done for the part back, and sometimes that's not possible due to core returns, but on a window regulator that's probably not  an issue.
