Ronaldinho gets the wrong card
What does a red and yellow card mean?
was on Barca in a friendly in Baltimore in the summer around 2010' I think.. The only thing I remember is sitting in the fucking nosebleeds and still FEELING the sound of Drogba kicking the ball from 40 yards out and lining a goal.
