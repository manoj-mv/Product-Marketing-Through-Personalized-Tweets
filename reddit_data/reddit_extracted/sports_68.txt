Disc golfer completes impressive albatross (double eagle) with shot around blind corner
Funny timing for this clip to surface again.  I was just playing this hole a couple of hours ago was standing at the exact spot he threw his approach in from.  Standing at that spot makes you appreciate just what a great shot that was.
