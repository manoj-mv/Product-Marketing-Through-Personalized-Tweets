Chloe Kim land back-to-back 1080s for the first time in Olympic history to win Gold in the Women's Halfpipe with a 98.25
The fact that two 17yr olds are going to Senior Prom this year with Olympic Gold medals is pretty crazy. The only thing I accomplished by senior year in HS was a participation bowling trophy. ople throwing down triple cork 1600s or whatever insane nonsense it makes these runs look like nothing in comparison.
