Sanders Applauds New Medicare for All Study: Will Save Americans $450 Billion and Prevent 68,000 Unnecessary Deaths Every Year
Honest question: what are the odds of something like this getting passed between the House and Senate?eld and I can honestly say that we are super overwhelmed with the current patient load. 

Don’t get me wrong, I believe in medical care for all. I just don’t know how our current infrastructure would be able to handle a significant increase in patients. I work in a large hospital and we are running at a minimum of 98% full 100% of the time. The US population is incredibly unhealthy.
