Chocolate Chip Cannoli [homemade]
NOPE!!! Cannoli are Sicilian. You need REAL ricotta that is made only in Sicily (within Italy is completely different) and doesn't have chocolate but pistacchio. And most of all the body (scorza) must be perfect and fried the same day not something industrial thing.
