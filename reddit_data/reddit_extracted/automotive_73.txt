Can frozen valve stems break off easily?
Any plastic or rubber does get more brittle at extreme temperatures. 

\-13F seems like a bit of a stretch.  I've had new valve stems function well at -35F with no problems.  My guess is that they were probably close to going out anyway and the cold weather just pushed them over the edge.
