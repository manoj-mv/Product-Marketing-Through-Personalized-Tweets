John Oliver Is Calling on You to Save Net Neutrality, Again
Oh the irony!

Thanks FCC for showing us why this is bad, and limiting our access to dispute this with the same tactics the ISPs could use. search all these comments for terms like "support" and "oppose" and get most comments saying they "support" net neutrality and say, "hey look, all these tens of thousands of comments are supporting docket 17-108! We should pass it as is!"
