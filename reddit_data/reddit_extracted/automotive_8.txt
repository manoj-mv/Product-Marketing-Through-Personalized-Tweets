Manual Transmission Anxiety
I just rec higher and dump the clutch on steeper hills to start. If it squeels the tires I really don't care. I'd rather do that than roll back or stall.you're more comfortable.  
and practice what to do if it stalls, Clutch in rock to neutral and crank start er back up and into gear and away.
