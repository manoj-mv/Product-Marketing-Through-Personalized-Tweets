Kickflip late back foot impossible by William Pilz
I always wonder how skateboard tricks were performed before everybody had access to slo-mo cameras. 

70s kid: *Dude, I totally just pulled off a back twist 720 kick flip!*

Other 70s kid: *Shah right bro, looked like the board barely spun once.*

70s kids: *Dude, it was just spinning so fast you couldnâ€™t see it with the naked eye!*
