Why do new cars have such bad factory orange peel?
Cause manufacturers care more about their profits and less and less about the products they make.  Which is why your paint color never matches on your bumpers and plastic pieces 
Iâ€™ve seen cars that jambs were not even painted from the factory on the road 
Think about the  massive recalls and service bulletins trying to correct issues that were broken from the start.
