SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME - Official Teaser Trailer
- Looks like it’s a loose interpretation of “Spider-man No More!”  (Which the 2nd Raimi film was heavily based on)
- The mysterio that they’re setting up almost seems too obvious, especially if you have passing knowledge of the character—I wonder if there’s going to be more going on or if they just thought people would be more oblivious to what character he was playing. 
- pretty curious about Fury showing up. I wonder if this film is going to allude to some new type of “saga” with this next phase of if it’s jusy some fun excuse to have SLJ blow dart a kid in the neck. Either way, I approve. 
- I’m just so pumped for more webslinging. Spider-Man has always been my favorite character since I first opened a comic book and the last movie totally understood the important balance of fun and heart that makes the character.
