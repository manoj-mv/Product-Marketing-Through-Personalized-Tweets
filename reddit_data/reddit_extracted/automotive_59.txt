[2000 Grand Am] Repacking the engine?
Do you have any more background? 

"Dirty" coolant would not warrant tearing the entire engine apart and replacing all gaskets. However, if there's a bunch of oil in the coolant and coolant in the oil (and often other symptoms), that typically indicates a head gasket problem. At that point tearing it down and replacing all gaskets would make sense. 

Did your mechanic ever say blown head gasket?
Does the engine ever over heat?
