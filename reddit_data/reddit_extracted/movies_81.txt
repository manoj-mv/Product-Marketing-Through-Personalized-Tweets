The year that made The Matrix, Office Space, The Iron Giant, The Sixth Sense, American Beauty, The Blair Witch Project, Fight Club, and more: Looking back at 1999, before franchises took over theaters
Yesterday's Super Bowl trailers were almost all sequels. I'd point out that when comparing which movies are getting funding and making money at the box office, we consider evolution of technology as a contributing factor.

In 1999, HDTV's were just beginning to release for the average home consumer. Projection big screens and Plasmas were only obtainable by the affluent home theater enthusiast. LCD 1080p screens would soon become affordable to the everyday American, taking more and more people out of theaters.

Internet piracy was getting to extremely high levels, nearly every movie was leaked by DVD screener and people now had the TV's to watch them. 

Theater viewership declined causing the movie industry to turn to 3D movies as a way of bringing people back to the theater. James Cameron doubled down on this technology when Avatar released in 2009. 

The point is that there are still plenty of original movies, it's easier to make a movie now than ever before. The funding for full length feature films is highest where they make the most money, guaranteed blockbuster franchises which are best viewed in theaters or the occasional date night romcom or scary movie.
