Oregon children who aren’t up-to-date on their vaccines will be sent home from school starting tomorrow. This year’s ominously named “Exclusion Day” is February 21. Required vaccinations include those for whooping cough, polio, chicken pox and measles, according to the Oregon Health Authority.
Remember kids.  Nobody is against vaccines.  They are against the fact there is ZERO oversight in to what goes in to vaccines.  There's still a $100k prize out there for anyone who can prove they are safe.
