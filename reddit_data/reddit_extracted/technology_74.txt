The FTC Should Fine Itself for False Advertising for Promising You $125 From Equifax - Consumer groups say the FTC engaged in the same false and deceptive behavior it’s supposed to police.
Fuck Equifax. Who the fuck are the ‘credit companies’ to say anything about the ability/willingness/etc to be worthwhile for credit? Why couldn’t I create my own credit company? How do they even make money? It doesn’t even matter. They should be fucking broke and shut down. All of them.
