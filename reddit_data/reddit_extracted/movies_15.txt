First Image of Josh Brolin as Cable in Deadpool 2
Whomever is charge of the costumes for Deadpool needs to do the X-Men. This is amazing.ual X-Men movies ever did

And why?

Attention to detail and intelligent casting, just like what the Avengers did.

Bryan Singer cast whatever pretty boys he was fucking (or wanted to fuck) without caring much about really capturing the character- that's how we got what's his face as the 19 year old non-russian colossus, or the guy who played ice man, or the kid playing pyro, etc. etc.

Can't wait to see what Deadpool does with X characters where they actually take their time
