Brendan Fraser on His Comeback, Disappearance, and the Experience that Nearly Ended His Career
Damn I loved this guy, genuinely seems like a nice dude.
Wouldnâ€™t mind seeing him do some more stuff. We need to make a subreddit to show him some love like we have other people in the biz eart-breaking. Losing your mom, your body breaking down, the acute self-loathing, failed marriage...Its a small wonder the man managed to persevere and still build a decent life for himself and his kids. Big respect to Fraser from a lifelong fan, I hope his second wind as a character actor takes him far.
