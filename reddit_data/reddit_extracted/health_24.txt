95% of women do not regret having an abortion, finds study
It's almost like thier smarterer than average mansot a valid argument, I'll just have to say the 4 or 5 friends of mine who suffered serious regret years after their abortion flies in the face of this study.  And since we now know that the vast number of scientific studies are proven to be complete bullshit, my anecdotal evidence seems more convincing.
