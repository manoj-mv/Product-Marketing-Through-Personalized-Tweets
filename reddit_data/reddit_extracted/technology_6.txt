Reddit just passed Facebook as #3 most popular website in US
Serious question, how is Yahoo.com the 7th most popular website??st don't believe anything on here anymore, everything is a possible salespoint, PR campaign, or good old manipulating of the publics opinion.

This site has become a marketers wet dream and it's disgusting

Fuck you reddit
