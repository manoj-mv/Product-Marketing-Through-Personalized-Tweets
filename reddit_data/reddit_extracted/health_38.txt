Hawaii is considering a bill that bans cigarette sales to anyone under 100
Ugh. The negative health effects are basically exaggerated propaganda. You need to smoke a pack a day for 50 years to even have a 7% chance of developing lung cancer for example. You can still fall ill though if you smoke excessively. The problem here is the high consumption. When doing any drug you should do it in moderation. People should be encouraged to smoke less. Selling it by the pack and not setting recommended limits is the reason why consumption is so high. It has given the impression that smoking all day every day is the normal way to enjoy this drug. It's not. Set recommended limits. Start selling smaller pack sizes and single cigarettes. Current tobacco policy is ridiculous and harmful.
