Germany‘s last minute goal against Sweden
I turned this game on this morning as background noise while i was reading. I am not invested in either of these teams but i looked up to watch this kick and flung my book across the room screaming at how amazing this shot was. Then i realized i didn’t really care about the outcome of this game and picked my book back up.
