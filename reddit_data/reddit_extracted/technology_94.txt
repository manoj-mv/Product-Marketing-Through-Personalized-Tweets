Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: "The Vast Majority of Reddit Users are Uninterested in" Victoria Taylor, Subreddits Going Private
My take on this can be summed up as:

- What she said is right.

- She was wrong to say it.

It also proved something I said in the middle of all this drama: Reddit is very much like a small child, easily to distract if you give them something shiny to play with.  I gave Reddit a week, two at max before the subs come back and the majority of people move on.  The admins know this so they'll be sitting back waiting for it all to blow over like it *always* does.  Once again I overestimated Reddit; it only took two days.

On another note, the way Pao talks and treats Reddit reminds me *very very* much of my current boss.  She knows better than the users and developers despite having no experience in anything related, a history of failed projects, a sense of entitlement, not listening to any suggestions, making and changing decisions based on whatever way the wind is blowing... This is not going to end well.
