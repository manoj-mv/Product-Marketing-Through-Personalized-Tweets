Why Everybody Should Be Very Afraid of the Disney Death Star: “Disney would control as much as 40 percent of the the U.S. movie business, and 40 percent of the U.S. television business”
I mean movies aren't putting water in my cup or food on the plate. "Afraid" no. "Annoyed" yes. ig telecom. NBC Universal is now part of Comcast, Warner and AT&T are going through the motions etc...

Disney is trying to avoid that by increasing their content and going direct to consumer. 

Honestly, I'm more ok with Disney owning more content than the companies who own the content and distribution channel.
