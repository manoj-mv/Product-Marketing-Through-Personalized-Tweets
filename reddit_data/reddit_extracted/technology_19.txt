Redditâ€™s The_Donald Was One Of The Biggest Havens For Russian Propaganda During 2016 Election, Analysis Finds
I'm sure this thread will have a reasonable, respectful debate.g:

The Russian propaganda in question is a single Twitter account @TEN_GOP.

The source for the article and its resulting title is [this reddit post]().

As far as I can tell, users posted links to a propaganda Twitter account (truthiness of specific tweets not included), "some of which garnered thousands of user upvotes" (quote from article), which is not at all surprising on a site where the majority of content is voted on by title and never read.

"One of the biggest havens for Russian propaganda during 2016 election, analysis finds" is a bit of a stretch.

This reads like a blog, and it's really just a summation of the aforementioned reddit post, except with less substance and more sensationalist title.
