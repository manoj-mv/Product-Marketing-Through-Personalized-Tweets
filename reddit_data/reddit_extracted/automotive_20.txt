Should Dash / Rear Cameras be a standard in every vehicle?
They can definitely save anyone from false accusations (could also screw you over for insurance claims) but I'd like to see both back and front cameras be available in all vehicles. 

Rear view or back up cameras are now mandatory in all vehicles sold in Canada. Had I waited another few months before it became law, I could have had it installed in my truck for free since it was a new model purchased through the dealership. But I didn't know about this being passed and now have to fork over $1000 to install the oem camera.

Am looking at aftermarket systems that work with stock radio but might toss in my own radio.
