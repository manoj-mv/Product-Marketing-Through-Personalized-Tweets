AT&T paid $200,000 to Trump’s attorney, Michael Cohen, and the payments stop right after Trump’s FCC pick Ajit Pai repealed net neutrality
News flash, AT&T spends money on lobbying the US government.  This is not something specific to the current administration.  AT&T has been spent between 14 to 20 million on lobbying each year for the last ten years.   Refer to  for the amounts spent each year since 1998.  

And BTW, Ajit Pai has been advocating for repealing net neutrality since at least 2012 when he was confirmed and joined the FCC board; President Trump that nominated him as board chairman in Jan, 2017.
