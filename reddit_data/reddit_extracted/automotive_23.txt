Be careful with jack
I don't even have jacks, lifted my car using the lift that came with the car because that's all I had. Put 2 bricks under each side (right, left, front, rear) and put a small piece of wood on top of the bricks so I don't damage anything under there. When it was time to go under I went overkill on safety. I put a large piece of wood roughly the same size as the two bricks just in case the bricks snap it will fall on this solid piece of wood. I also put tires under because you can't be safe enough.
