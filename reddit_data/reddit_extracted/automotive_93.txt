Zero Compression
Just because your RPM guage doesnt move doesnt mean it haves no compression... means your crank sensor is not picking up anything... some crank sensors have an adjustment so you can calibrate it ... meaning push it in or out... just make sure you dont push it all the way in or you might hit it with ur flywheel... start with that...
