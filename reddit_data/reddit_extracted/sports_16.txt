Concession prices at the Atlanta Falcons' new stadium
There was significant debate internally around the pricing of alcohol (a debate that has been going on for decades at most ball clubs). Decreasing the price of beer, increases consumption, which not only increases the liability/headline risk for the ownership (e.g., drunk driving, in-stadium accidents, etc.), but also significantly increases the chances of in-stadium fighting. Research shows that having someone witnessing/being near a fight during a game is the quickest and most dramatic way to ruin that fan's experience and make them less likely to return. Most ball clubs have raised the prices of alcohol significantly over the years to combat over consumption (with other concession prices following suit, unfortunately). 

Though many advised not to decrease alcohol prices by the same extent as food for this very reason, it looks like the Falcons are taking a risk for the sake of consistency. Should be interesting to see how it plays out. My gut is that we'll see an increase in alcohol prices by the 2018 season.
