Musician uses algorithm to generate 'every melody that's ever existed and ever can exist' in bid to end absurd copyright lawsuits
Im confused... I was under the impression (that i got from someone who studied music many years ago) that melodies couldnt be cooyrighted because there was a not-so-large finite number of them. Recordings could be copyrighted, but not the combination of played notes. Was I under the wrong impression? And if so, wtf...
