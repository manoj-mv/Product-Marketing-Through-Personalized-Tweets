The Trump administration paid a bankrupt company with zero employees $55 million for N95 masks, which it's never manufactured
Shower thought: let's assume for a moment that Hilary Clinton really was hiding information in a private email server while serving as a government representative. What sorts of things would we be concerned she is doing?

- Bribing other countries and donors
- Diverting government funds
- Back channel communications with unelected officials

AKA, all the things the Trump administration has been doing out in the open. I guess people really did just want transparency, they don't care what you do as long as you're transparent about it *sigh*
