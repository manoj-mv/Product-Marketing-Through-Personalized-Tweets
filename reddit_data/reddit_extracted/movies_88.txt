Joker - Final Trailer
Reminds me a little of Falling Down, but with clowns-so-great are unfounded, as the direction, cinematography and acting here look so goddamn stellar, and I think the idea of a 'Joker origin movie' where he literally becomes a crime underlord in Gotham has *so much* potential. Pleaseeee be good.
