[Homemade] Buffalo Hot Wings
I want these inside me now. They look amazing!!!t home. You've never had good wings until you've cooked them yourself with fresh ingredients and eaten them right away while they're still hot. Way cheaper too. 

I deep fry them using a recipe I read somewhere that involves tossing them in a little flour, spices, and baking soda or powder (can't remember) the only thing is they are a lot better if you let them sit for an hour in the fridge before frying them.
