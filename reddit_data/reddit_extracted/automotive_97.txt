How many miles are cars engineered to last?
It's all about maintenance.
My 2002 Accord is still running like a dream at 521330km right now. And I beat the hell out of it every day. I commute over 200km round trip in it daily. And I am not gentle. It gets all of its services on time, but sadly will soon need to be retired because the rust is getting structural (Ontario). 

If rust wasn't a thing, I'm sure i could keep it going forever.ehicle, its determined to be a total loss. Which is cool, because you can often buy them back, less your deductable, fix them cheap, and sell for a profit.
