After 4 days of trekking over the Salkantay pass to get to Machu Picchu, I woke up around 3:30 am to try to get there before the rest of the tourists. 100% worth it for seeing the sunrise alone.
Hold up... it takes four days of “trekking” to get there??? And what is trekking exactly? Is that an extra white way to say hiking?
