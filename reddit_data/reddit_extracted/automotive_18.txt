Changing tires for the first time - things to consider?
Pretty much as easy (or easier) than changing a flat. Do one tire at a time. Remove hub caps if necessary to access lug nuts, loosen lug nuts before jacking the vehicle up, then remove once it’s in the air. Installation is reverse of removal. Make sure you tighten the lug nuts down very well, although I have never paid attention to torque specs. Check tire pressure, fill where needed.rive and it will tel you the best procedure. After taking any wheel off and booting it back up. You’re supposed to re-torque them after so many miles. Not everyone does this but it’s good to say maybe after a week of driving (couple of days depending on how much driving you do) to just snug them up again to make sure they’re still on tight and not coming loose.
