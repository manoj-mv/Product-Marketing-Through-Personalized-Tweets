Andrew Yang: What good are record-high profits if we have record-high stress, anxiety, student loan debt
But...it's...what corporations crave.ddle man. He has a lot of Left ideals, but he is thinking of the future of humanity as a whole.   
I think he is running too soon, but who knows if we'll even make it to a time period where I feel his campaign would be needed. 
    
Right now we are at a standstill, politically. The Right and Left are fighting eachother, with no room for resolution.     
The right won't even look at Yang's statements, because they are super closed minded right now, and the Left probably won't recognize Yang's ideals because they are just focused on taking back the majority. 

Its sad. But I think a lot of Yang's ideals are needed, as technology continues to fill the roles of the working class.
