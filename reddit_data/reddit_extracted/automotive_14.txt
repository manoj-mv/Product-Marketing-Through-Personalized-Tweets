Floor board soaked on a Chevy 2005 HHR
2005 is a bit young to have rusted through, but if leaves have gone down the windscreen rain drain channel and blocked the outlets, your firewall can eventually be eaten through, causing exactly this. This is expensive, because the entire dash needs to be removed to get to the rust and kill it. I have this issue in my '86 MR2 - years and years of it built up.
