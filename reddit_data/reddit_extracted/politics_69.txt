Ocasio-Cortez calls for 'answers' after Epstein found dead in jail cell
An article on ABC news said he was not on suicide watch at the time of his death,  after having supposedly tried to kill himself a few weeks earlier. Who made that decision? Where is the video of his jail cell? How much were the guards paid to look the other way?

Furthermore, the 911 call was reportedly for a cardiac arrest, yet he was found with marks on his neck from an alleged hanging? Who found Epstein hanging from a rope in his cell and thought to call 911 for cardiac arrest? How does that make any sense at all?

Lots of questions need answers but we'll probably never get them.
