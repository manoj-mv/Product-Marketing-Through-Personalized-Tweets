How safe is it to buy a used car from a dealership in US?
Bring a mechanic friend, I know a decentish amount about cars so I was able to haggle about $200 off on the price of my car due to some albeit minor fixes. But even if you canâ€™t haggle having a mechanic friend there will help, they will be able to tell you if a car is ganna be worth the cost of fixing any issues it may have.u can go back to the dealer and they will usually try to make it right with either a repair or sometimes even another vehicle in extreme cases.  They don't want bad online reviews, and the BBB and FTC are your friends if they did happen to give you any trouble.  If they are a reputable dealer they will probably pay for the carfax on your chosen vehicle if you only but ask.  That and using your own eyes and ears might give you enough peace of mind to complete a purchase.

Bargaining is getting more difficult, but you can always try.  Get their "best price", then make an offer of 10-15% less to drive it off today and see what happens.  You would have better luck with this tactic if you had your own financing lined up and/or were buying the vehicle outright.  Keep your emotions out of it, and be willing to walk away and sleep on it.  They will always sell you the car tomorrow.
