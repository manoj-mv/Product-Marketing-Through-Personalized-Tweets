Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez To Co-Sponsor House Bill Banning Members Of Congress From Trading Stocks
I 100% would support this move.  I cannot think of a single benefit to having politicians be able to trade stock while in office.  

The politician and their spouse should be prohibited from buying/selling stock for their entire term.

Sure some of them would find ways around it...but it would also stop a lot of them from being able to do it so easily.
