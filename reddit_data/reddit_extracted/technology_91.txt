Wondered why Google removed the "view image" button on Google Images?
I know this is quite late after thread was created, but does any of you know how to get the same image but in a different size? Before you used to be able to click on the image size (i.e 600*400) and the same image would pop out in different sizes hosted on other websites. Was superuseful if you were working with an image you are going to print, but now it's gone as well...

The only side-fix I have right now is to reverse search the image on google with their "search by image" option but looks like it isn't returning as manu results as it was before...
