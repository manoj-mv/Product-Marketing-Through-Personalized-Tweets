Patients with heart attacks, strokes and even appendicitis vanish from hospitals â€” many doctors believe the pandemic has produced a silent sub-epidemic of people who need care at hospitals but dare not come in.
Or maybe also people are just less stressed, sleep more and have to work less?ss I was absolutely sure the risk of dying if I didn't go was greater than the risk of getting COVID.

The PPE shortage means nurses are wearing PPE that they wore in COVID+ rooms out into the hallways.  They are touching supply carts, the Pxyis, going to the nurses station etc while wearing that contaminated PPE.  The contamination has to be extensive. That is why nurses caring for those on droplet precautions normally doff by the door inside of the patient's room.  

I would not be afraid of coming into contact with an infected patient.  I would be afraid that the total abandonment of infection control protocols would lead to contaminated supplies or a staff member carrying the virus getting me sick.
