[](#bot)x absolutely every part you are worried about, or do the Impolite Customer Dance and say "yeah, you know. I'm not that fascinated by this blue colour any more. I'll have that brand new green one that you have on display. This afternoon will be alright. We'll call it even."

You have the ultimate leverage on them if they have to weigh setting things right quietly against having the brand representative questioning them on your behalf. You can be polite about it and you can be a PITA, it's up to you. I honestly think that you will have more success getting what you want if you try to stay calm and politely point out that most things that are wrong can be fixed, and that the only reason that they get to fix it is that they did the wrong to begin with.

Then, of course, request that they set aside funds so that you can use their money, go to another workshop that you trust, and have them review everything that is done with your car. There is no reason to give them the impression that you trust them.

Feel free to spread the word, but wait until you are positively certain that they no longer have any wish to help you. So, ahem, wait until after they have fixed your car.
