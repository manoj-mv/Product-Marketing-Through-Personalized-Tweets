Boy who suffered up to 100 seizures a day has none in 300 days after being prescribed cannabis oil
Is there anyone on Reddit that doesn't like weed? Holladent, and was having multiple seizures a week for years, then she started using some cannabis product and hasn't had one in two years now. 

I've never cared much for pot or anything, but how we're not legalizing it everywhere by now is ridiculous.
