What do mechanics often do/say when they can't find the right part?
I used to work at a dealership in the US and we were limited to using one supplier and the local parts stores or dealerships for parts for our used cars of different makes. If we couldn't source it from a dealership or our supplier we'd check the parts stores. The parts store's system for looking up parts doesn't have updated data for rare cars. So even if a part from another car from the same maker was used in the rare car their system doesn't reflect that. That paired with the fact that most people that work at a parts store don't care to try to look for a part. I know that if you go to O'Reillys, they have a separate menu you rare and exotic cars that most employees don't even know about. I'm not sure if privately owned garages are the same, but this was my experience with a dealership.
