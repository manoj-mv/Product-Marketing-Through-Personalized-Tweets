Lord of the Ring's 'Battle of Helm's Deep' battle scene took over 3 and a half months of night shoots to finish. Computer software was created specifically for the scene due to the massive crowds needed. Clocking in at 39 minutes long with a full narrative arc, it is almost a movie within a movie.
It's one of, if not the, single best fantasy set-piece battles ever put to film.

And yet people keep seriously comparing it to the gaping, monumental nothingness of the latest game of thrones episode, a battle that is to helms deep what a rotting cow carcass in a ditch is to a fine steak.
