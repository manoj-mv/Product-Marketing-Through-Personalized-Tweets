The first film to be screened in Saudi Arabia after a 35-year ban on cinemas was 'The Emoji Movie'
starved for 35 years and the first thing they serve you is a plate of diarrheahat really changed my mind was I got reamed out by a marine in his 40s-50s after me and my friends made some distasteful comments about the country and it's people. He said that the generosity and hospitality of the Saudi people is second to none of the 20 countries he's visited in the world. This happened in front of a bar/restaurant full of people, some who added to it as my friends tried to argue with him about the unfair treatment of women... One of his marine buds who stood up said almost verbatim: *"in our country, we treat women like sex objects.. In their country, they treat women like prized trophies.. Yes, it's objectionable as well, but we can only learn to respect other's if we can come to understand that not every culture is the same and chooses to live using their God given free-will the same."*

We were so humiliated we got up and left as people clapped, some who were our own age.
