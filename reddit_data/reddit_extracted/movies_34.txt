Netflix takes over lease to iconic but failed 71-year-old movie theater in New York City to show its own original films.
Theyâ€™re doing it so their original films will qualify for movie awards like the Oscars. One of the requirements is having the movie screened in theaters. No minimum requirements on the number of screens. 

So the Oscar committee will likely update the rules to require X number of screens shown to try and exclude Netflix and others from doing this.
