Bring Back Hand-Drawn Disney Animation
Quit paying to go see live action remakes. 

Also on a side note: if you’re going to see a Disney movie, especially a remake of a Disney movie you probably saw as a child, for fucks sake: show some good damn maturity/restraint and don’t immediately go to r/rant and whine about how many children are at the movie. It makes me just... really really feel embarrassed for you.r brain will always fill in the blanks giving you a genuine emotional connection. But we are living in a time when audiences just want shiny things beamed into their eyes instead of appreciating an art form. Not that 3D animation isn't that, but sometimes it just feels so cold and sterile in comparison. 

Anyone that thinks a photo realistic warthog singing is better and more magical than a cute and chubby character drawn by hand is just wrong.
