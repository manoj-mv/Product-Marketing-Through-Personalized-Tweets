I quit my day job to make what I genuinely think is the most helpful movie suggestion website in the world: recommending highly-rated BUT little-known movies. Would love to hear what you guys think
I quit my day job to write comments on Reddit... but sadly it doesn't pay shit. Just karma.mom and dad for help. I like your website idea but the market is seems very saturated. It will be difficult to make a living doing this.
