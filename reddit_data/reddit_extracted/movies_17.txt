Golden Globes: 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' Wins Best Animated Feature
Very deserved. Just watched it, and was stunned! The visuals are amazing, and the soundtrack and story are almost just as good. One of the best superhero movies ever, at the very least.an like a film much more than this one.
