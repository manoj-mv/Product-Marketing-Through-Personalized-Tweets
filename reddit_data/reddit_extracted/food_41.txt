[Pro/chef] Smoked burnt end cheese burgers
While I am a fan of cheeseburgers, making them out of burnt ends is an abomination.  The only thing worse would have been to make one out of A5 Wagyu.gers. So far, every "gourmet" burger I've ever tried has used a brioche bun that was itself greasy on the outside, so I got greasy fingers from the bun. So pointless.
