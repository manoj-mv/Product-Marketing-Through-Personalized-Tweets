Little bit of coolant in oil - used bars head gasket fix - now car overheating bad
You have all the evidence you need.  Head gasket completely blown or a severely warped/cracked head.   You have to stop driving this car before you burn/score/ruin every bearing surface in the engine if you haven't already done that.   Head repair is significantly less than a total rebuild.r reading mostly positive reviews decided to try it. Never had any overheating before that. 

Any questions on things i missed PLEASE ask.
