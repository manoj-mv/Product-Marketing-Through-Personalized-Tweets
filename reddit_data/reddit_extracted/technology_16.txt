PornHub, OK Cupid, Imgur, DuckDuckGo, Namecheap, Bittorrent, and a bunch of other big sites have joined the Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality on July 12 (Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, and Reddit were already on board.)
I'll be honest, I never even really knew what Net Neutrality was last time this was a big issue. All I knew is that reddit likes net neutrality so I would sign just about every petition that showed up on reddit.

After doing research, this is absolutely fucked and the FCC is a big old shitbag if it allows this kind of shit to happen.
