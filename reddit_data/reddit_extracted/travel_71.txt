I got a room for $25 and was the only one here - Ao Nang, Thailand.
I'll be moving to Hawaii in the next few months and the wife and I have been thinking of places to vacation to in case we ever get island fever. Anyone have any experience with living in Hawaii and vacationing elsewhere? If so, where did you go and how was the experience?
