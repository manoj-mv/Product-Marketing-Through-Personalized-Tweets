Did walmart break my axle?
There's not enough info to make a judgement call here, unfortunately. 

What type of vehicle do you have? Is it an all wheel drive (not 4x4)? Did you replace the tire with a new one of the same size? 

Is there any indication loose lug nuts? Any missing? Any sheared off studs on the hub, or wallowed out holes in the rim? Front wheel drive or rear wheel drive? CV joints are a common failure point on F/AWD and IFS 4x4 vehicles. Did the brake guy show you the broken axle?
