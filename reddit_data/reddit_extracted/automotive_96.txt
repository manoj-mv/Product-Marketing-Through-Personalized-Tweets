Leasing a Car, is it worth it?
Buy a JDM car from the 90's-2005.

Cheaper to buy with cash, but finance is always an option.

Legacy is a great car, you'll probably have a lot more fun with a WRX STI though, depending on if you prefer technology over raw power.

Edit: If you can, buy it. You'll be adding an asset to your books. :)
