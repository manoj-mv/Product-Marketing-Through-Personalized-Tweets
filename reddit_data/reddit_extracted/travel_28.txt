How not to be a tourist 101. As a Canadian I am ashamed and embarrassed. Don't be like these guys.
I'm so glad that this is getting the publicity it deserves. As a Montanan, the idiocy I see displayed at our national parks is flabbergasting. Hopefully this makes people think twice. I think these morons are going to get the book thrown at them.
