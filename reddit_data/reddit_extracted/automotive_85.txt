So Iâ€™m having alignment issues and need advice.
The toe is -1.7 on the right and +.01 on the left giving me a total toe of -1.6 r a parking block or an animal at high speed?   If so, they may be on to something.   Either way, I would recommend you take it to someone who is not a dealer for a second opinion, that will be able to fix it sooner and charge you 1/3 as much.

I probably wouldn't mention the dealer opinion at all until they give you a diagnosis.  You won't have good results if you don't tell them what happened to help them know where to look - cars usually don't suddenly go out of alignment without a wreck or a failed part.
