WHO urges ban on high levels of sugar from fruit puree in baby food - High sugar content may be threat to first teeth and affect food preferences in adulthood
Then they are going to have to ban fruit itself bc there is a lot of sugar naturally.st adult food is a terrible scam as well.

For any of our readers who might not have heard, you can make your own baby food, and you can also just feed the baby little bits of your own food (with a few exceptions such as unpasteurized honey, and if you like your meat rare it probably isn't a good idea to feed the baby that, and so on).  You need to think about choking hazards, and remember that babies tend to swallow things whole and sometimes inhale first so no whole peas and things like that.

You can do the whole [premastication thing]().  You can use a spoon or fingers, doesn't have to be mouth to mouth.

There are many ways to do this.  Talk to your pediatrician first, don't take advice from a stranger on the internet.
