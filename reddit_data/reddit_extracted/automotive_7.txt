Hello fellow redditors, have any mechanical issues with your car that you cant figure out? Message me your problem maybe i can help! :)
I have an '01 Chevy Malibu (155k miles, 3.1L V6), and I love it. Thing is...my gas mileage has been god awful lately (250 miles per tank on mostly the interstate).
I used to be able to go about 50-60 miles before the needle got to 7/8ths of a tank, but now it's at just below a quarter after the same amount of driving.
All the tips I've read are simple shit like "take excess weight from your car" or "keep your tires inflated", you know, the type of things I've always done.
My question is, do you know of some *relatively* inexpensive fixes to get back up to my old standard of 29-31 MPG?
I haven't changed a thing about my driving style or practices (ie tightening fuel cap, keeping tires inflated) since before this random loss of fuel effeciency, so I'm kinda confused why it's bad compared to what it used to be.

Thanks for posting this. I didn't really want to make a "Help me" post here
