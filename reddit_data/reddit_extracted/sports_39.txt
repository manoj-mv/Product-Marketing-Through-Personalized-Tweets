Still can't believe this....can't think of many other untimely deaths as impactful as this...but shit there's a lot tbh, Heath ledger comes to mind.th is tragic but he did die having lived his life and career, post retirement and the fam was what was left and it sucks we will never see it but she got robbed of her childhood, her career, hell a future love. It all fucking sucks, for them and all those who died.
