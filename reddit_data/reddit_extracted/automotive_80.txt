Purchase a Honda CR-V with 200k miles?
I own a 1997 Honda CR-V, these cars are wonderful when taken care of and with the 2.0L, it should only have one. DIY work should be easy and cheaper than what was quoted for by the muffler shop. 

$600 with maybe $300 (converter and tools)?jump on it! Transmissions will last if you take care of it. Check your fluids, make sure they aren't going to look black, don't smell burnt, don't feel gritty. 

At 200,000 miles, get an over all checkup from a trusted mechanic. 

Transmission fluid changes are do-it-yourself friendly and cheap. Although, if you have a little more $, I recommend getting the original transmission fluid for the CR-V to ensure longetivity. It's semi pricy, but it will give the performance it should have. 

P.S. If it's an AWD, Never put mismatched tires on it. It will destroy the driveshaft.
