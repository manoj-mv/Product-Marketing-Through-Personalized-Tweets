Apple Is Blocking an App That Detects Net Neutrality Violations From the App Store: Apple told a university professor his app "has no direct benefits to the user."
My dad submitted an app that scans the AppStore and tells the user which apps are potentially dangerous and breaks down what data apps gather from your phone. 

Apple blocked it because they said no one cares that there are malicious apps on the AppStore.

Total bullshit.
