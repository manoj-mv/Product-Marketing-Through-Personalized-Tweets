5 critically ill COVID patients (on ventilators) received antibody-rich plasma from 5 other patients who had recovered from COVID.
While I donâ€™t think anything is going to help in our current outbreak, it is refreshing to hear a bit of good news. This can be helpful for future outbreaks. Everyone stay safe!
