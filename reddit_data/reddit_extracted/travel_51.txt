Went to Edinburgh and it was amazing. The architecture of the buildings was mind blowing.
Coming from someone in the UK who lives in an old town, other than the cool mountains, this just looks like a typical old shithole you could find anywhere in the UKBarrel or something. Beautiful architecture with lots of history. Walked up and windy AF Arthur's Seat and took home a piece of a dead volcano. Really lovely place.
