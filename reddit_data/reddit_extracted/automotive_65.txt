Tint brand recommendations?
I have had several of my cars' windows tinted.  It never occurred to me to ask a question about brand of tint.  I simply went to reputable shops, asked what they used, along with any info about how long they warrantied their work.  I've heard names like 3M, Solarfilm, Llumar, Lexen get thrown around.  Never heard anyone say that any one is better than any other.  I've never had an issue with any of my cars peeling tint or de-laminating, or anything like that.  

I have no advice on how-tos in this regard.  All the online stuff I've ever seen seemed pretty straightforward.  Assuming you're going to buy pre-cut patterns for your car?  You have any personal preferences on ceramic vs carbonized vs regular ol' tint?
