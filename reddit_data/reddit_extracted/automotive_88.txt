Guide to fix tube exhaust tube thing [Image included]?
I count 4 welds on that section of pipe lol. There's no repairing that. You need a flex pipe, flange, some flavor of exhaust clamps (there's a few), and extra tubing. Possibly the rental of a flaring tool from the auto store parts counter.


Find a secure, solid, level section of ground that's not solid due to ice and jack the vehicle up. Lower it down onto jack stands. Toss some old cardboard under the vehicle to lay on, do the scoot scoot to get under there.

Here's a guide.



Edit - Also your tire is low on air.
