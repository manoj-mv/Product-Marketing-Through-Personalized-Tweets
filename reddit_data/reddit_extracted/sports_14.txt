Friend who lost his leg to cancer got creative for Halloween
Being the smug parent I am I showed this to my teen & asked if she got it......"Broken ankle?" she said, my smug level increased, no have a proper think about it......no advances on broken foot? What happened in Boston? Her "ohhhhhhhhhh". 

Then she takes my phone & scrolls the comments........put me back in my place ðŸ˜‚
