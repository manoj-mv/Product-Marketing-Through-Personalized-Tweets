Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is the only live-action film in the top 25 worldwide box office of 2017 to be originalâ€”not an adaptation, remake or sequel.
The last time the top live-action film was totally original was 2009 (Avatar). Before that, it was 1998 (Saving Private Ryan). Interestingly enough, that was the last of three straight years of original movies winning, four if you count Toy Story (which was animated). 

BTW, the last time before *Avatar* that the top movie wasn't based on something of ANY kind (even a historical event) was 1996 with Independence Day. Before that it was 1990 with Home Alone.
