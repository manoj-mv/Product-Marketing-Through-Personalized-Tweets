2005 Chevy Silverado LS 5.3 V8 issues
When you accelerate or decelerate with engine breaking, the yoke will slide in and out of the transmission tailshaft a couple inches due to the leaf springs flexing and the resulting pinion angle change. The shiney area your seeing out the the housing is shiney because its constanting moving in and out of the seal. If your driveshaft seems too short, its due to the lift, not the transmission replacement but with only a 6" lift, the 2nd shop probably already knew that....they just saw dollar signs when you came in talking about it.Hope this helps you out.
