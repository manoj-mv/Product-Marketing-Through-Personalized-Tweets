Do you maintain your own vehicle and how to you keep records?
I do all my own maintenance and repairs. I don't do anything fancy, In the file cabinet I have a folder for each vehicle. When I replace a part the receipt goes into it's respective folder. This way I have the receipt for warranty and documentation if needed. As far as oil changes, all my vehicles have an A/B trip meter, A is for my current tank of fuel and B is for the current oil change. If I want to know my fuel mileage I take the A trip and divide that by gallons filled and make sure I remember to reset trip A. When trib B gets to 4k miles I change the oil and reset.

The only exception to that is my pickup which only has a single mode trip meter that only goes to 1k so I have one of those things in the corner of the window the quicki lube places put up there for oil change tracking and a bunch of paper slips for it. I document mileage at oil change, oil type and what kind of service I did at that time so I know for the next oil change. Automotive repair need not be complicated.
