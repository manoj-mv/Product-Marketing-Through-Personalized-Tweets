Magic mushrooms could replace antidepressants within five years, says new psychedelic research centre: ‘People on antidepressants long-term say they feel blunted, with psychedelic therapy it’s the opposite, they talk about an emotional release, a reconnection’
As I read through this article, I couldn’t help but think of the way economic push back this will receive from more established pharmaceutical companies. Although some may like to believe that the world we live in may revolve around policies, laws, regulations, health bills, etc. that are done in the best interest of most; my current personal conviction is that there is a vested interest in legalization / criminalization of substances, habits, etc (such as the illegal use of psychedelic mushrooms in the UK, as mentioned in this article) and that this interest is more dedicated towards serving a select few (such as: those with a large economic investment within the major international pharmaceutical corporations). Ultimately, as I read this I feel a sense of indifference; since I understand that the current science of most things lags behind in terms of any true understanding of the nature of the physical realm that surrounds us; and lags even further behind in terms of trying to understand mental health. At best, we deceive ourselves and those who may truly be suffering and those who have been duped into thinking they have a disorder that is out of their control to again revert back to a cycle of trial and error with a substance, that if deemed profitable, will likely one day be legalized within the UK and perhaps it’s sister nation, the US, so that private corporations may agin reap the benefits, until further research shows the negative and effects of psychedelic mushrooms and another substance be legalized or criminalized. This way the recycling nature of the global economic infrastructure may continue to loop back as it has since generations past. So, I repeat that I feel indifferent. I see neither good nor bad will come out of this; but I do sense a bit of dismayed at the overall poor quality of the increasingly subjective nature of the mental health field.
