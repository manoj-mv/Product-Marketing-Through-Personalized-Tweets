Netflix got booed at Cannes, but it's not responsible for killing movies; at least it finances auteurs. A lot of blame should go to the major studios, which have become sequel and franchise-obsessed
Name a point in history where humans didn't use new technology it invented.

You can't, because we don't.

If you fight against technology, you will lose every time. Your only choices are to embrace it, or lose.

Up to you which one you pick., sophistication, and certainly without vision.  And on the corporate end / agenda / propaganda side... big budgets only polish a turd they can't give it heart & soul.  There are no more captive audiences, just opinions.  

It's no different than the music business right now.  It sounds like corporate crap because that's what the media outlets 'allow' and promote for the sake of branding and pandering. 
But if you scratch the surface there's tons of great original music buried by zero media attention, cock-blocked buy big money's wall of static.
