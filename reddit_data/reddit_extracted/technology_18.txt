74% of Netflix Subscribers Would Rather Cancel Their Subscription Than See Ads
Animelab an Australian anime streaming service is free (subtitled) anime with a single ad at the start and one in the middle.

You can then pay for a subscription (similar to Netflix price) to remove ads and get dubbed content (English voice actors)

This is really the only way I see ads on streaming services working. If I pay I shouldn't have to watch ads.
