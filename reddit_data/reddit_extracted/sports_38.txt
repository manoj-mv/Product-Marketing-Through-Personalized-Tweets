Aaron Feis, an assistant football coach at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, died a hero yesterday as he saved countless students by shielding them from the shooter.
I still actually don't know what the name of the shooter is/was. Glad I found out this gentleman's name first. dickhead who committed the crime. Forget him. Heâ€™s a nobody.
