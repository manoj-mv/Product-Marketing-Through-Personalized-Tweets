Random curiosity question: do your brakes wear more while slowing from 60mph to 40? or 20mph to 0?
I will say 20 to 0. Why? Well for starters let off the gas and just let the car coast from 60, and see how it slows down to 40. Now try to get a car on level ground to coast to a stop from 20 to 0. Your car is designed to use its momentum to turn the engine when your foot is off the throttle. This allows the fuel injectors to completely stop spraying fuel as you coast down hills and such. On top of this the vehicles rolling resistance and drag is higher, and all aid in braking. So in a leisurely stop 60 to 40 you have other methods of braking at work for you, while from 20 to 0 it is much more up to the brakes themselves.
