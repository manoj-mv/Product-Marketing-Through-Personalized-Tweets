Disney Reinstates Director James Gunn For ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy 3’
I honestly, as much as I had wished and hoped, did not see this ever happening. Well I'll be damned. I'm a huge MCU fan, and am happy to be alive in what I feel like a golden era for film, especially that the biggest stuff happening in the movie theaters feels like it's catered personally to ME! My own personal taste, stuff I grew up with.

And now, to see that Disney won't let themselves be bullied into taking away a director that fully understands what makes these movies great. Thank you Disney.
