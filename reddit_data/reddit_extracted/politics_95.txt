Sanders says he'll enact national drinking water standards
Oh my god. How is this already not a thing.I hope congress does their part to enact this as well. But I doubt any of it will. I’ve lived long enough to know that once a president gets put into office, these types of promises are never fully fulfilled. If we’re lucky, we’ll get a diluted form of this. I guess that’s better than nothing.
