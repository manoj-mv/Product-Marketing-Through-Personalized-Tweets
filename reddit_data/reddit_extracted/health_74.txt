Daylight Saving Time is literally killing us - The interruption to our internal clocks is a welcome reprieve each fall, but in the spring it literally kills people: incidents of heart attacks, strokes, and fatal car accidents all spike around the start of Daylight Saving Time each year.
No ones talking about how dark it will be in the am if we stay on permanent DST. How about 8-8:30 am before the sun comes up? What about kids taking buses in the dark because people canâ€™t handle moving forward in time once a year and the back an hour once a year. In theory it sounds great as we all hate losing that hour in spring but you have to consider more than the annoyance of it.
