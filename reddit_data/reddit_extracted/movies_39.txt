About 60 artists who created hero makeups and background masks in 'Bright' were left out of the credits
Does anyone pay attention to the credits anyways beyond the cast that they see in it?


I mean... I put in over 2000 hours per year designing, developing, marketing products for the company I work for.


Guess how many customers see my name in the product manual, on the box, or on the company website? 


Zero. 


I get paid to do my job. I don't get to put my name on it.
