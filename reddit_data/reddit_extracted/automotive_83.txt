Need help 2005 hyundai tuscan.
Does anyone know the answer to my question about it being flooded?e vehicle into clear flood mode. It essentially turns off the injectors. 

That being said if you smell gas STOP. Raw fuel will destroy your catalytic converter fast. Locate the fuel pump and injector fuses and pull them. With those out, crank the vehicle a little while for 5 seconds or so at a time to clear the flood you just gave it. 

Reman starters are generally garbage, new OEM is recommended.
