US Doctors Call for Universal Healthcare: "Abolish the Insurance Companies"
Universal health care works in smaller countries. It won't work in the states. Best to have very cheap medical insurance and allow the companies to compete to the lowest price instead of voting in corrupt politicians who fuck with the system. Competition will get you the lowest priced insurance with the best coverage, not a guy in Washington.
