It's forecast to be really hot in Prague today, so we decided to get all of our sightseeing out of the way between 5:30 and 7:30 this morning. Couldn't have made a better decision.
I am not sure if OP is from the US, but this approach is so typical for US visitors. Getting up super early to think they avoid anything :-D

The crowds in Prague are usually not that bad. Specifically compared with other major cities.
Also much of the Prague vibe only works with many people. Thats the beauty of the city.
