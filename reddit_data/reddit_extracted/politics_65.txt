Iraqi Parliament Votes to Expel All American Troops and Submit UN Complaint Against US for Violation of Sovereignty. "What happened was a political assassination. Iraq cannot accept this."
Can we start a movement to notify the leaders of the Middle East that these are actions of a rouge government and not the actions or desires of the majority of the American people?

I hate the thought that there will be retaliation and it will not be the American leadership that is going to face the consequences of their actions, but the American citizens that are being dragged into this unwillingly.
