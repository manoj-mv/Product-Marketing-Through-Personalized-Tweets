Channing Tatum Joins the Cast of Ryan Reynolds’ Action-Comedy ‘Free Guy’ - About a bank teller stuck in his routine that discovers he’s an NPC character in brutal open world game.
They did some filming for this at my work. They were filming on two street that intersected and my office was the building at the corner of the two streets, they set up the streets to look like the world in the game and were filming was seemed to be a bunch of establishing shots, it was so weird to see firetrucks, police cars, city buses, joggers, mail men, couples, etc driving and walking up and down the street all day but knowing it was all fake. I can't wait to see some of the scenes they were filming and knowing I'm in the middle of all of it lol
