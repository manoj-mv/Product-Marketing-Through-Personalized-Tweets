A Texas theater shut down a few weeks ago. This week they decided to turn their outside wall & parking lot into a drive-in theater with free screenings & carry-out food for sale. Every ticket through Tuesday has been sold out and the theater is planning on adding additional showtimes to meet demand.
So this will be a new hotspot to spread the disease because of the choke points. 

I dont think people understand the severity of what is happening right now.us thing came.  

We implemented "skip parking" (leaving an empty space between you and the car next door) - cars ended up being parked about 20 feet apart.  We implemented a "one person per vehicle" rule in the concessions lobby to order food.  After ordering food, we sent folks back to their car and texted them when their order was ready to pick up.  Worked great.   We then launched an on-line app to order your food from your car.  You could order it and pay for it without leaving your vehicle.  We sent you a text when it was ready.  Worked great.
The last two weeks we saw people being overly cautious (which is a good thing) - standing 6 -10 feet apart for restroom lines, etc.  People understood the necessity, but still appreciated the fact that we were trying our best to provide any sort of entertainment option while also doing our best to keep them safe.

Tennessee Governor shut down all non-essential businesses yesterday which effectively closed us down.    We'll be back.. just not sure when.  In the mean time we'll be sending the bank a box of "thoughts and prayers and like and shares" in lieu of our mortgage payments.
