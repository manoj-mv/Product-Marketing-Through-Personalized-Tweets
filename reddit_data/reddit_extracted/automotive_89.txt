automotive technician real life experiences ?
Auto Tech from small town TN here.


I didnt go through college or a tech school, but nerded out on hard through my life. Ive spent less then a year in this field and have made myself decently comfortable in the process in my short time. If not in my pay, then at least in the work. My pay is 22 per flag hour, and at my small shop, Ive averaged 40 hours a week regularly. I still invest heavily in my tools and abilities. I dont regret the effort, mental or physical, but it is significant.
