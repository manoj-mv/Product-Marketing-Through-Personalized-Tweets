Whatâ€™s the minimum amount a car should be driven?
It's not necessary to drive it though if you do plan to store it for a while, start it up and let it reach full operating temperature every so often to keep the seals lubricated. Wouldn't hurt to put it up on jack stands either to keep the pressure off the tires.
