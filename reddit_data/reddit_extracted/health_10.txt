The first coronavirus case in the U.S. and South Korea was detected on the same day. By late January, Seoul had medical companies starting to work on a diagnostic test — one was approved a week later. Today, the U.S. isn’t even close to meeting test demand.
In terms of scale and complexity of communications, the US suffers due to its large size compared to South Korea. There is also a larger amount of government interference with the medical industry in US tied to the huge subsidization of the health care industry primarily through Medicare and Medicaid. This is a major reason why health care costs are much higher in the USA as well.
