Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Official Teaser Trailer
I wish this trailer had ended with an ominous voice saying, "Mesa back!!!e we saw is from the first 10 minutes of the movie.  The hand and then pulling back to gasping Rey is just like the TFA trailer with the desert and Finn popping up.  Nice call back.  The music is wonderfully used--especially Rey's theme.  We see just tiny glimpses of other things like Finn, but in a way that we don't know for sure what happened.  Or Kylo's mask.  And then Luke's last sentence, creating such a mystery about whether he means what he says or just hasn't finished the sentence.  I hope with all my heart they keep the rest of the trailers this tight so as not to spoil the whole movie.  Well done!
