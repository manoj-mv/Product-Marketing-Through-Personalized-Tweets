1 in 5 New Yorkers May Have Had Covid-19, Antibody Tests Suggest
What’s scary is that this virus was in NYC longer than first thought. Yes, the back door, as Governor Cuomo put it, was left open. Unfortunately, we have all been walking around others who have this. It is by grace of GOD that many of us have been spared. As the ‘melting pot’ of the world, it is also an epicenter. I am heartbroken by the loss of so many, not just here, but all around the world. I can’t believe I’ve lived to see a plague; a plague, not a pandemic. Hopefully, we can be tested to at least have an idea of who around us is effected. Let’s pray the coming winter will not be half as bad as this thing started. It’s so aggressive is what makes it so scary to many. We will prevail on the other side of this.
