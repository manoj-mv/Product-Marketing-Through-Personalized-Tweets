Parasite Wins Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards
Willem Dafoe should have won best actor. his lobster speech was GOAT. Parasite GOAT tho, glad we got onebut, "Barking Dogs Never Bite" - I watched it after seeing Parasite, and was amazed that there were some thematic similarities between the two despite being released 19 years apart (though with very different kinds of characters and events). Not quite as tightly written as Parasite but head and shoulders above tons of Hollywood fare nonetheless.
