Oh good. Did it control their blood pressure better than the anti hypertensive medication they stopped? Did it control their blood sugar better than the metformin they stopped? Did they stop their statin?

Marijuana is great for a few things. It does not replace all or even any of the important mortality reducing medications we commonly give patients. ecause it does nothing for me doesn't mean it can't help someone else. Marijuana has plenty of bona fide medical uses even if legislators don't want to legalize it for recreation.
