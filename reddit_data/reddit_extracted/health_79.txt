Magic Mushroom Ingredient Psilocybin Aids Depression and Should Be Reclassified If Clinical Trials Are Successful, Experts Say
I know most might disagree, but I do think most of the anti-depressant effects of tripping are mostly if not entirely caused by the placebo effect, or by some external realization you already had but were concealing, and that taking shrooms is what simply made it come out and into fruition. Just like how a drunken person says certain things they normally wouldn't if they weren't otherwise intoxicated. It's not as if alcohol made that idea appear, no, the thought already existed, but not being sober is what made it actually come out, or at least turn the feeling into words to be communicated. Think about it, some people smoke weed and frantically start cleaning their room or brainstorming about innovation while others can get high off the same strain and want to just sit on the couch and eat or just do nothing for literally hours. It's not that the weed made you do the activity, it's simply that being high allowed the thing to become reality, when really you already wanted to do whatever that was anyways but your thoughts led you away from it while you were sober, and those same thoughts just went away and got overshadowed for a bit after you hit some thc. With mushrooms, someone may want to already overcome whatever is causing their depression and know what they could do to better their condition, but feel as though they need help from an outside source, and that taking magic mushrooms may be just the thing they need to uncover their eyes/mind, when in truth they were the ones covering their own eyes/mind in a way, but just didn't want to accept it, or see it that way, whatever the case may be. With most change in life, an alteration of your perspective is usually all you need, and for some people tripping on psilocybin could be what triggers that change in their perception, thus leading to a 'cure in depression'
