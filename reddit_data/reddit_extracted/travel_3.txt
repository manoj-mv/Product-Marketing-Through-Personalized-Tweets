Wife and I hate big social events and love traveling. So rather than a normal wedding, traveled to Switzerland and did our vows in private. Photo from the day
Sounds like something I would do lol, congrats P? Only reason I ask is it tends to be difficult to get married in some places, and I know location of origin helps I think? We'd like to do this someday too.
