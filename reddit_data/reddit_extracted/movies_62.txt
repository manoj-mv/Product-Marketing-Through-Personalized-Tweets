The Cast of Guardians of the Galaxy release statement on James Gunn
I was banned from r/marvel for saying that I actually support Disney in their stance of cracking down on this behavior. They banned me for "spam", my only message there was saying that I agree with Disney.

I don't really care if you agree with me or not. Getting banned from a subreddit for that is pretty sad. I'm actually glad they did, if this middle ages censorship is their way of dealing with people they disagree is not a place I want to be in.
