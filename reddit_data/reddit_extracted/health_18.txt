250 more hospitals just joined in on a plan to make their own drugs and the effort could upend the generic pharma business - A group of hospitals have built a nonprofit generic drugmaker
Most generic pharmacutical companies are marking up the necessary drugs you need to function up to 500%. My economics professor told me that and he used to be in the generic medication business from a large company (he wouldnt tell us which one of course for privacy reasons). That business is "rape and pillage", HIS WORDS!!!!

 That is not gonna change overnight but i am INCREDIBLY PLEASED that this is even starting to happen! SUPER AFFORDABLE MEDICATIONS FOR EVERYONE!!!
