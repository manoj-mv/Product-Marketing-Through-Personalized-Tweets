mouse stank is stinking up the place...
I heard foggers work well. You run the car and hvac while the fogger fills the care with fresh scents. Amazon carries them. But next step is taking out the carpet, seats maybe dash. Steam clean everything. I had a similar problem with a truck I bought. Replacing the carpet and cleaning sTeam cleaning EVERYTHING seems to have done the trick. I took the dash and hvac system out also. But, I was doing a project build, so it was coming out anyhow. The carpet from factory interiors was $280 iirc. Installed it myself, pretty simple.
