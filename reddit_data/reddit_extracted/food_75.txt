[Homemade] Rainbow Cake
I love the top chocolate layer. You pull it out at a party, everyone thinks you burnt the cake because of how black it is and avoids it. Only your true friend who would eat anything you made to make you happy cuts into it, and is pleasantly rewarded with a color party of flavor for their trust.
Plus the dark chocolate layer makes the colors so much more vibrant!
