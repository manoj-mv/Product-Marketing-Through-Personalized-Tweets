Cleveland Browns fans hold parade after historic 0-16 season
If you’re one of the people out there that is at a parade for 0-16, I will fight you. Come down and see me right now, I’m at Buffalo Wild Wings.

EDIT: Welp, *nobody here gets the show.*  This is part of a rant from a Cleveland-area sports radio host who protested the parade last year, lampooned by The Dan LeBatard Show with Stugotz.other player sooner or later.

Browns?  Probably remembers Jim Brown, the Dawg Pound days of throwing doggie treats into the end zone for their scoring players, and still wears the colors in solidarity with the people of Cleveland and the Browns they'd like to see not be whatever these fuckin' Brown management makes them suck every year.

Ah, but there was the years before the move where it was grand to be a part of the Browns fanbase.  And I think Browns fans now hang onto the hopes of the Dawg Pound fervor having something to cheer for in the constant despair that is Cleveland.
