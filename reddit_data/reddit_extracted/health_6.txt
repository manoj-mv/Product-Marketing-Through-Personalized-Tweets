Our ancestors didn’t suffer from hay fever and food allergies were extremely rare even a few decades ago. Science shows that it’s the distance from, and lack of exposure to, natural environments that is driving the allergy epidemic in modern life.
When we were kids, during the summer my mother would wake us up at 600am. Cook us breakfast and shove us out the door on her way to work at 6:40am. She locked the door behind her and we had no keys and were stuck outside for 9 hours on our own. This was when I was 8. Even during the school year mom and dad would make us go outside and play "and don't come back until the street lights are on."

My cousins on the other hand were coddled and babied until they were in college. "Oh no, they don't play outside much, they might get hurt" is something my aunt actually told people as a point of pride.

We played in the mud, played with neighborhood dogs, poked dead animals with sticks and built dams in the creek bed until we were caked in mud and grime to the point mom would have to spray us off with the garden hose naked in the back yard before we were allowed back in the house. We were 9 and 11 and walking 5 miles one way down busy streets to the comic book store with our allowance to buy trading cards. Afterwards we would stop by dad's work and watch him do autobody repairs for an hour or two before he drove us home.

Guess which group of cousins is allergic to everything under the sun and have underdeveloped jaws?
