Tom Brady Calls Coca-Cola & Frosted Flakes 'Poison for Kids' - In defending his holistic trainer, the New England Patriots quarterback takes aim at how food companies have hijacked American nutrition.
I wonder how much soda and sugary drinks Tom consumed as a child. And it limited him to only being a multi-Super Bowl winning QB worth 10's of millions.

I'd like some of that "poison", please.
