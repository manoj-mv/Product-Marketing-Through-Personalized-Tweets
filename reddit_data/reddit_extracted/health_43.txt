Young children are not being exposed to microbes as they once were, and their immune systems are not being properly primed. A cocktail of microbes could be given as a yoghurt-like drink to very young children in the future to potentially prevent leukaemia, type 1 diabetes and allergies.
How about just handing out fewer anti biotics?ssive research focus and therapeutic choice in the near future, be careful, the big guns are now claiming mothers milk can cause Cancer.
