‘Star Wars’ Setback: ‘Game Of Thrones’ Duo David Benioff & D.B. Weiss Exit Trilogy
That's a relief. 

But seriously, Lucasfilm has mismanaged this series from a .. well, management stand point so hard. Marvel had it's share of departures, but, it feels like Lucasfilm has had a 'Edgar Wright leaving Ant-Man' headline for most of it's movies (as in a very public departure after a very splashy announcement, which companies don't like doing)

1. (minor) Ardnt left TFA due to the rushed schedule
2. Josh Trank fired from his spin-off 
3. Major reshoots on Rogue One with Tony Gilroy brought in to oversee 
4. Lord/Miller fired mid-production on Solo, causing most of the film to be reshoot
5. Colin Trevorrow fired in pre-production on IX 
6. Benioff and Weiss leaving their trilogy

Like, seriously, what the fuck is going on with this property. The turnover is insane.
