Senate votes in favor of overturning FCC on Net Neutrality
Right now I’m registered as an independent, but mainly voted Democrat and lean heavily to the left. I mainly registered that way to avoid the being tied to a party and to avoid the party BS robocalls come election time. 

Now I want to change that. Florida has a closed primary, which means that, as an independent, I can’t vote.  I screwed up in 2016 by not changing before the primary. I don’t want to get caught out again. 

But what frustrates me is that, in order to change my party affiliation, I still need to fill out a paper form and mail it in to the supervisor of elections. You’d think that for something as simple as this they would find a way to make it electronic by now. 

I’m done now.
