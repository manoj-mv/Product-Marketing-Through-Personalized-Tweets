US Doctors warned they will be fired if they complain to media about lack of resources
Not gonna lie, this makes sense...every company I’ve worked for doesn’t has us disclose information to the media even if it’s blatantly true. I understand this is different though but it makes sense where they’re coming from. It’s not even like they’re whistleblowing, it’s basically stating the sky is blue so it’s complaining for complaining’s sake
