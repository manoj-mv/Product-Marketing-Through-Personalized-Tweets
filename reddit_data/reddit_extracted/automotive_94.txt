Towing Advice
How are you planning to tow the Ranger?  Tow bar? 2\-wheel car dolly? Full car hauler?  First, I would suggest checking the tow capacity of your Jeep and then research curb weight of the Ranger plus trailer/dolly.  It may make more sense to haul the Jeep behind the Ranger dependent upon your configuration.

Would recommend making sure your Cherokee is in good running condition and all serviceable items are maintained before using it on a road trip.  

Is there anything you are specifically worried about that we may try to help you address?
