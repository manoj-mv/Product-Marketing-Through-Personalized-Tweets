Car won't crank while jumped but bridging the starter relay turns the starter.
I'd guess the voltage was too low for the relay to engage on its own and you had a poor jump connection.  When you forced the relay manually that presented pretty much a dead short to the jump, which caused the jumper connection to arc, creating a reliable connection.

Quick tip: if you can afford the time, it's really best to put the jumper cables on the car and let the dead battery charge for 15 minutes.

Really good jumper cables are a lifetime investment, btw.

Good experiment with the relays.
