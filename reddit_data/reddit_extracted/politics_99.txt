Mensa offers to host IQ test for Trump and Tillerson
You could never win against people like Trump, because either he won't take the test and he'll have some excuse, or he will take it, and either beat out tillerson, which will cause him to brag bigly, or he will lose, in which case he'll call mensa fake news, and say it was fixed or whatever. 

So, it's all a waste of time.

I have a good deal of experience with internet trolls that are just like that.

Logic and reasoning are useless against these people.
