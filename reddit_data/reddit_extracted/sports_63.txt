Jesus Christ. We've hit max saturation.

I don't think I've seen a highly publicized event of a woman doing something wrong without her insisting the reaction to it is sexist. It happens 100% of the time. It's literally the go-to response at this point.

We've gone way, way, way off the deep end with this shit. How bad does it have to get until we reel it back and start telling women, "*No*, women are shitty too, sexism isn't endemic."
