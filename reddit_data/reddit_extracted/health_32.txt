A county coroner noticed that several suicide victims had abandoned their pets at shelters. So they trained shelter staff to ask about suicide and immediately saved several lives.
Itâ€™s so good that people are spreading awareness of symptoms of suicidal thoughts. The more people who can recognize these signs, the better.

Symptoms include being preoccupied with death/dying, contacting friends who have grown distant to tell them thank you or goodbye, being severely anxious or agitated, being suddenly withdrawn, or abruptly turning to reckless, unhealthy behavior.

For anyone who reads this, if you think someone you know is suicidal, approach them and talk to them about it in a non-accusatory inviting manner. Be direct. Help them get to a doctor, and away from potential hazards (if they own a gun, if you find excessive amounts of pills, etc). If they are actively suicidal at that instant, call 911.
