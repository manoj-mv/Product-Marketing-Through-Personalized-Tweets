Nancy Pelosi won’t send the articles of impeachment to the Senate until she feels they’ll get a fair hearing.
Don't you guys just love how the GOP just yelled and screamed about getting a fair trial in the house, GOT ONE, refused to comply with any subpoenas, declined their invitation to testify, and now aren't going to offer up a fair trial themselves in the Senate?

Biggest fucking hypocrites in the Galaxy. Vote all of them out.
