Planned Parenthood ‘Fetal Tissue’ Investigation Finds Nothing - An $800,000 investigation into Planned Parenthood’s alleged ‘fetal tissue profit’ has come up empty-handed.
It SOUNDS like a lot of money, but the feds give PP $500 million a year, so this is 0.16% of their annual budget. Seems fair to prove nothing is mis-spent.ke money somehow. I actually think it's not a bad idea. A lot better than just burning it or dumping it in the sewer or whatever else they currently do with it. 

Edit: Yeah, I guess I'm the only one.... I mean, it's not like people are (generally) going to hold funerals for their abortions. The fetuses just go to waste.
