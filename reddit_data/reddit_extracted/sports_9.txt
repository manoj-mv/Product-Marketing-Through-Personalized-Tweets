Celebration after $75,000 half court shot
I was at this game!  This was the loudest I've ever heard a crowd erupt at any sporting event I've ever been to and I've been to quite a few over the years.at the other end of the gym, you'd get 20 homeruns for your team, since no one thought anyone could do it. I was first up, just praying that I could kick the damn thing and not make a fool of myself, and lo and behold I fucking sink that bitch right in the hoop, the celebration was pretty similar to this. Needless to say, I was the man for a few months that followed before everyone stopped caring and I went back to my reclusive ways. This video Just reminded me of this, what a good day.
