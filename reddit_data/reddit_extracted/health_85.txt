Having only 6.5 hours to sleep in 24 hours degrades performance and mood, finds a new study in teens. However, students in the split sleep group (night sleep of 5 hours plus a 1.5-hour afternoon nap) exhibited better alertness, working memory and mood than those who slept 6.5 hours continuously.
Shout-out to all fellow new parents. This is my life now.n blocks on short stints (like 3 days of overnights) itâ€™s much easier to sleep shift and feel better during the whole process.
