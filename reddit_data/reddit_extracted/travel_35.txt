Does anybody feel like going to a grocery store of a country you're visiting is one of the best cultural experiences and highlight of the trip? Y'know trying their local delicacies and snacks and such.
Not the best part of the trip but definitely a highlight. Also a great way to get souvenirs is by shopping in local grocery stores for the same products for a tenth the price compared to souvenir shops
