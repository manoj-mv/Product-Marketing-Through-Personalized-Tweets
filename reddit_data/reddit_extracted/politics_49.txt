The Anarchist Daughter of the GOP's Gerrymandering Mastermind Just Dumped All His Maps and Files on Google Drive
Gerrymanding is the root of evil in a modern democracy.al voting system where a party with x% of the vote would get approximately x% of the seats in the legislature.  Proportional voting is also superior to FPtP because:  
- It is more representative of the political views of the population.  
- Having more than two parties makes it harder to corrupt all parties.  
- It reduces vote wastage and makes it so every vote counts.  
- It allows voters to vote more honestly by eliminating (or at least greatly reducing) the vote splitting problem.  
- It creates a more competitive political environment where political parties can't simply get by on just being the 'lesser of two evils'.  
  
Not surprisingly, countries with proportional voting systems tend to have much better governance than countries with FPtP.
