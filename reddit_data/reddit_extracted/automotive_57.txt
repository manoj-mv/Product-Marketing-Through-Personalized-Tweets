Is it a good time to invest in a car due to COVID-19?
What do you think about real estate?t now so I too have thought about this. Ford is practically paying you to buy a car with 3 deferred on top of the three payments they’ll make for you, according to the commercials I’ve seen.

Not sure if we’ve seen the bottom yet though.
