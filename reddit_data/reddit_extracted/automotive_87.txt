Shop forgot to tighten my lug nuts. Whatâ€™s the possible damage and how should I be compensated?
Honestly sounds like they fixed it. Usually the damage happens when the wheel pops off. Stock wheels are strong and they replaced studs. As for compensation for a small shop like that they fixed it for free that's usually it. If they can afford it and they think they'll get your business back they might throw you a free oil change or tire rotation.
