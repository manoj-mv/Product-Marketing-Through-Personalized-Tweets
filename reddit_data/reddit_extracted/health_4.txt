Notice to pharmaceutical reps from the wall of my doctors office.
Came to comments for TL;DR summary. No dice. Bye.a drug rep is there to push their product, they're sales people.  But, they aren't all buffoons.  Many these days are pharmd's.  The blame really needs to lie on doctors backs.  Many use PDRs from the year they graduated without updates and few get any proper continuing Ed.
