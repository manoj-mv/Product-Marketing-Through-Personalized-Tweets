Ajit Pai calls California’s net neutrality rules “illegal” - California senator replies: The rules are "necessary and legal because Chairman Pai abdicated his responsibility to ensure an open Internet"
Hey look Pai, I can play the one-up game too:

The broader problem is that ~~California's~~ the United State's micromanagement poses a risk to the rest of the ~~country~~ world. After all, broadband is an ~~interstate~~ international service; Internet traffic doesn't recognize ~~state~~ country lines. It follows that only ~~the federal government~~ ICANN can set regulatory policy in this area. For if individual ~~states~~ countries like ~~California~~ the US regulate the Internet, this will directly impact citizens ~~in other states~~ across the world.
